1. Since STO and CFO are part of the information
for communication channels, unlike usual sensing procedures,
sensing-assisted communication channel estimation needs to
use the sensing information before STO and CFO calibrations.

To improve the Doppler resolution, the sensing
algorithm executed in the current slot can reuse the DMRSs
in the past S slots, if the total duration is within the radar CPI.

3. Can you elaborate more on this update rule, is it based on the pre-defined DMRS?
"The update check module will determine whether to update the LMMSE coefficients or not. 
If yes, ... will be updated with sensing results in the current slot."
